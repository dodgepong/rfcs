# Scene Organizational Tools


## Feature Summary

Allow users to organize scenes in such a way that they can easily find the scenes that they need to switch to or edit during both preproduction and live production.


## Motivation

Most OBS users never need more than a small handful of scenes with simple, static layouts. However, it's not uncommon for a user's scene count to grow rather quickly as more demands are placed on their production capabilities and requirements.

In many cases, this functionality can be solved through the use of scene collections such that separate shows can use separate scene collections, but sometimes a single production can still be unmanagably complicated, necessitating organizational tools within a single scene collection. Furthermore, it's often impractical to change scene collections in the middle of a broadcast due to flickering and unprofessional visuals generated by the live loading of soruces, as well as the lack of an ability to select the scene that is activated upon switching to a new scene collection.

Oftentimes, the largest culprit adding complexity to a production is the OBS feature that allows users to add scenes as a source inside of other scenes. This leads to a usage pattern whereby many scenes are simply "component" subscenes and used to construct other scenes, but are never actually needed for the purposes of switching during a live production.

Users would like a way to organize their scene list to make it easier to find the right scene at the right time whether they are editing their scene collection before a broadcast, or trying to switch to the correct scene during a live broadcast.


## Request For Proposal

Submit a proposal explaining how you will implement this feature such that it meets the following requirements:

* New functionality is added to the Scenes list that allow users to organize their list of scenes. Functionality includes:
    * The ability to group or associate related scenes together
    * The ability to conditionally hide or show groups of scenes or scenes that are otherwise associated with one another
* The new functionality follows or closely resembles existing established usability conventions such that users are more likely understand intuitively how these organizational tools can and should be used.
* The new functionality is easy to employ or delete, and scenes behave in a predictable manner when the functionality is deleted.
* The new function behaves reasonably in context of how the multiview is currently populated.
