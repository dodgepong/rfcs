# Feature Bounty


## What is a feature bounty?

OBS and VideoLAN have partnered to create a program where developers can contribute to specific new features of OBS Studio for compensation. These features are determined by OBS leadership to have the potential for high-impact improvement to the product. Any individual or a team can submit a proposal for a bounty, but the final payout will be made to only one stakeholder.


## Bounty Process Flowchart

1. The OBS team publishes a Request For Proposals (RFP) describing a feature that the team has decided should be prioritized, or a bug that is in need of being researched and fixed.
    * Initial Bounty Status set to **Accepting Proposals**
2. Developers write proposals for how they would implement the feature or fix the bug described in the RFP.
3. The OBS team works with developers to clarify and refine their proposals.
4. A proposal is accepted. The developer(s) responsible for the proposal work to implement the feature or bug fix according to their proposal.
    * Bounty status changed to **In Progress**
5. Pull requests are submitted to implement the proposal by the developers.
    * Bounty status changed to **Under Review**
6. Pull requests are reviewed and changes are made by the developer accordingly.
7. Pull requests are merged into the master branch.
8. Developer(s) submit invoice to VideoLAN for bounty amount, confirmed by OBS team members.
    * Bounty status changed to **Claimed**
9. Payment submitted to developer(s) by VideoLAN.


## How to Claim a Bounty

We've created a process to ensure multiple contributors arenâ€™t working on the same project and to make sure work is pulled into OBS once completed.

1. Read the Request For Proposal document completely.
2. If you want to move forward, submit an proposal to the OBS team on your suggested implementation by making a pull request modifying the `proposal.md` file inside the RFP's folder in this repository, noting that it addresses the RFP's associated issue number.
3. Work with the OBS team to finalize plans for the best implementation. Proposals will be judged on their maintainability, design quality, and adherence to spec. Note that other developers may submit competing proposals at this time as well.
4. If your proposal is accepted, you may begin code implementation that adheres to your proposal and following the [OBS contributing guidelines](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst).
5. Submit code as a draft in the appropriate `obsproject` repositories so OBS community leaders can track progress.
6. Once code is complete, remove draft status and notify OBS maintainers.
7. Update code with feedback from core OBS contributors as needed.
8. Wait for your code to be merged into the `master` branch.
9. Submit an invoice to VideoLAN for the amount of the bounty.


## Collaboration with OBS team

Collaboration with the OBS team is crucial to having your code pulled into OBS. During the proposal process, clarify any questions you or your team may have as early as possible. During development, use the pull request commenting feature. At any time, you can also comment in the `#development` channel in the OBS Discord server here: [https://obsproject.com/discord](https://obsproject.com/discord), though we encourage you to keep as much discussion on the pull request as possible to keep the discussion public.


## Deadlines

If your team does not show code commits or interaction for two (2) weeks at a time as part of an accepted feature bounty, then the bounty will be released for another team to work on. If the task is **Accepting Proposals**, and the team can show work on the feature, they can reclaim the task.

If you are no longer going to work on the project please notify the OBS team to reset the bounty as, **Up for Grabs**.


## Bounty Valuation

The OBS team currently uses a simple rubric to determine how to price a bounty. Generally speaking, RFPs are evaluated based on two main criteria:

* How complex is the feature/bugfix?
    * How long do we expect it may take to complete?
    * How much specialized knowledge do we expect it will require to implement?
* How high of a demand is there for this feature/bugfix?
    * How many people do we expect this to impact?
    * How frequently are we asked about this feature or bug?
    * How urgently does this need to be implemented?

In general, issues that are higher in complexity and higher in priority are given greater bounties.
